- ### TA position for Math 241 in Spring 2022 filled

  发布时间: 2022年1月26日 星期三 下午02时24分50秒 CST

  

  The TA position for Math 241 in Spring 2022 has just been filled with a well-qualified master student of ZJUI. Thank you for your applications, of which I consider several as equally well-qualified and hope that you keep up your interest in the TA job until the next occasion, which is perhaps Math241 in Fall 2022. Then more TA positions will be available.

  Some of you have applied for Math 286 instead, but those TA positions had been filled already weeks ago. Earlier, when I mentioned this opportunity in class, I didn't anticipate the great interest in this TA job by our senior students, sorry.

- ### Final Grades

  发布时间: 2022年1月25日 星期二 上午11时50分10秒 CST

  

  Final Grades for Math 286 are out since a moment. You can find solutions for the final exam in the folder "Exams". For a full score in the final exam you needed 45/53 marks, and the extra credit score could be traded in for 5/45 final exam marks (whichever was better).

  **Note added on Tue Jan 25: The total score computed by BB is just fake. Your actual final score is the figure in the column "Final Score". It was computed according to the formulas I have communicated earlier. The grading scheme used for computing the letter grades is**

  **A: 100 - 85, B: 84 - 70, C: 69 - 60, D: 59 - 50, F: 49-0**

  **The subdivision into signed grades A+,A,A- and B+,B,B- was done approximately along the obvious boundaries.**

  The final exam solutions don't contain notes on students' solutions/errors yet. If you have questions about the final exam grading, it may be better to wait for these notes to appear on BB (hopefully tomorrow).

  Enjoy your holidays, and I wish you in advance a very Happy Lunar New Year of the TIger!

- ### Call for 1 TA for Math 241 in Spring 2022

  发布时间: 2022年1月10日 星期一 下午07时45分50秒 CST

  

  1 TA position for a Math241 (Calculus III) class of ca. 16-20 students in Spring 2022 is to be filled in. The job responsibilities are the same as usual (teach 1 weekly discussion session, grade the weekly homework of students, grade the midterms, do 1st-round grading of the final exam).

  If you are interested, go to

  https://zjuintl.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/ApplicationforTeachingAssistantatZJUI/ERy1pdrfeKFNsA39QuTAhPkBgtZbbatajhcJ9RmxD0crxA?e=QqnH7d

  and fill in the necessary information. The TA job will be assigned to the best-qualified candidate, in case of a tie to the one who applies first.

- ### Last minute information about final examination

  发布时间: 2022年1月4日 星期二 下午06时18分13秒 CST

  

  The Math286 final exam will be held tomorrow Wed Jan 5, 9 - 12 am, in LTW 201.

  Below you can find a link to the final exam coversheet (in the folder "Exams"), which lists the rules for the exam. I hope we have communicated these rules before. Please note that you are allowed to bring only 1 cheating sheet, which must be in A4 format (single or double sided) and **entirely hand-written**. In particular it is forbidden to use a copy of a cheating sheet written by somebody else. We will check cheating sheets during the exam and take away any printed/partially printed/copied sheets.

  BTW, I at least think that the cheating sheet is not necessary if you have prepared yourself well (as you do, e.g., when writing the cheating sheet;-).

  Good Luck!

- ### About lab project

  发布时间: 2021年12月22日 星期三 下午12时02分58秒 CST

  

  For the lab presentations this evening 6-8 pm I have booked our classroom LTN-A 301/302. Yu Chengting will tell (has told) you the time of your presentation. Students need to be present only for the presentation of their work group. Upload your presentation file before the presentation so that you can access it in the classroom (USB may not be available).

  Please upload your lab presentation/report also to BB. For this I have created a BB assignment "lab project". You can do this after the presentation today (even tomorrow). Today it is important that you bring a printed copy of your lab report, with the said integrity statement signed by all group members, to the evening session.

- ### Finally Back to Normal!

  发布时间: 2021年12月20日 星期一 下午01时38分48秒 CST

  

  After the pandemic situation has stabilized, our Campus is resuming normal operations. For Math286 this means:

  The last three lectures on Wed 15-17, Fri 16-17 this week will be taught in LTN-A 301/302 as usual. The lecture today is still taught online.

  On Wed Dec 22, 6-8 pm we will hold lab presentations. The precise timetable will be made by Yu Chengting who will assist during the session. Each work group has 15 min for the presentation, and all group members should have a fair share in the presentation. Before the presentation you must hand in your lab report as a paper copy. Please include the following statement, signed by all group members: *We declare that this report is our own original work. For its preparation we have not used any other resources than those cited as references. Every group member has a fair share in this work.*

  The deadline for HW13, which should still be submitted online, is deferred to Wed Dec 29, 6pm.

  Looking forward to seeing ALL of you in the classroom on Wed afternoon!

- ### Math 286 Lecture remains online on Dec 20

  发布时间: 2021年12月19日 星期日 下午06时48分54秒 CST

- ### About Homework 13

  发布时间: 2021年12月16日 星期四 下午05时31分13秒 CST

  

  The deadline for HW13 has been set to Wed Dec 22, 6pm. But we are aware that the schedule may be too tight for you next week, having to deliver lab presentations and submit lab report and HW13 all on the same day. Also, we do not yet know whether on-campus teaching and other activities can resume next week. So we ask you to wait a few days for a more targeted announcement regarding the semester finish.

  We were just informed that, due to the epidemic situation, all teaching will remain **online until Sun Dec 19**. Thus the Math286 lectures on Mon, Wed, Fri will again be taught online, the discussion session on Thu evening will be online, and you have to submit HW12 online on Thu evening. For details (URL's, etc.) see last week's announcements.

  I am sorry for the inconvenience, TH

- ### About Homework 12

  发布时间: 2021年12月10日 星期五 上午08时45分54秒 CST

  

  A corrected version of HW12 has been uploaded. The Heaviside function is now denoted by "u(t)" and its translates by "u_c(t)" as in the lecture. I made this change, because the old notation "H(t)" leads to confusion with the notation H_n(X) for Hermite polynomials and H(s) for the transfer function of a linear 2nd-order ODE.

  Also, on this occasion I made H72 an optional exercise to reduce your workload a bit. The many optional exercises in this assignment are due to the fact that last semester we had more time towards the end of the course (and hence more time for exercises). Since the exercises are very instructive, I didn't want to remove them completely.

  The deadline for H73, H74 has been reset to next week. These exercises won't take you much time, I think.

- ### Lab project enrollment

  发布时间: 2021年12月8日 星期三 下午05时40分24秒 CST

  

  I was informed by our TA's that a considerable number of students enrolled in Math286 couldn't be assigned to a lab work group so far, because they missed the last (or last two) discussion sessions. If this applies to you, I urge you to attend today's online discussion session (starts in less than 20 minutes, see separate announcement) and ask Yu Chengting to put you into a lab work group.

  If you are retaking Math286, you have to do the lab project afresh. Otherwise the lab score will be set to zero!

  In the lecture we are a little behind schedule and will have discussed the material required to solve Exercises H37, H38, and H40 of Homework 6 in full only after Wednesday's lecture. For this reason we have extended the **deadline for H40** (which is a very instructive exercise, but quite elaborate and not directly relevant for the midterm on Nov 10) until **Fri Nov 12**. Nevertheless, there remains quite some work to do for Thu/Fri (mainly on H38), and you are advised to attempt at least H37 in advance, perhaps after previewing the relevant material in lecture23-26_handout.pdf (Slides 41, 42, 45, 46).

  If you are retaking Math 286 this Fall semester - either because you have failed the course before or you want to improve your existing grade (which is possible only for grades C- or below) - please note the following:

  All assessments (homework, midterm, lab project, final exam, extra credit) are taken afresh. The only exception of this rule is that you are allowed to present previously done homework to your TA for recognition. This is done on a per exercise basis (because only some exercises match those of previous semesters).
